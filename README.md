## Games :

### Dino

You are a dinosaur who needs to hates running into cactus. Press space to jump over them.
However you are a dinosaur who has a degree in Mechanical Engineering. You have built yourself a <b>gun</b> which you can shoot down the cactus. To reload you need to keep ducking(arrow down key).

### Chain Reaction

The classic Chain Reaction game. Keep filling up a slot untill it explodes in all directions, conquering the neighbouring pieces.

### Snake

Keep eating the green square to grow longer. The longer you grow, the stronger you become. Be careful, sometimes becoming too big can destroy someone!

### Space Invaders

Enemies keep advancing towards you. Can you shoot them down to stay alive?? You have 3 lives to find out!

### Tetris

A 3 unique block game of tetris.
